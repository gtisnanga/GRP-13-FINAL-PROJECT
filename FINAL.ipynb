    " ## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction \n",
    "In an era where public opinion on products can shape brand perception, companies increasingly rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for real-time customer feedback analysis. This project, applies NLP techniques to classify Twitter sentiment related to Apple and Google products, addressing a real-world need for understanding public sentiment in a rapidly evolving market. By using sentiment polarity classification,it provides actionable insights into customer satisfaction and emerging issues, enabling companies, marketing teams, and decision-makers to make data-driven decisions. These insights help brands like Apple and Google improve products, refine customer support strategies, and optimize marketing efforts based on social media sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "The problem is to accurately classify the sentiment of tweets related to __Apple and Google products__. We want to determine whether a tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This classification can help companies understand customer satisfaction, identify potential issues, and tailor their responses accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Stakeholders \n",
    "- __The companies__: Apple & Google- Considering these companies are direcly affected by the sentiment, it is important for them to gauge the perception of their products so as to identify the areas of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Marketing teams__- this sentiment analysis and model can help them respond to negative feedback, adjust their marketing campaigns and highlight the positive aspects of their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __The customer support teams &decision makers__- the sentiment analysis is important for they can use it to improve product development, customer support and brand reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4  Business Value\n",
    "By accurately classifying tweets, our NLP model provides actionable insights to stakeholders. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying negative sentiment can help companies address issues promptly.\n",
    "- Recognizing positive sentiment can guide marketing efforts and reinforce successful strategies.\n",
    "- Understanding neutral sentiment can provide context and balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Objectives \n",
    "Main Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a NLP (Natural Language Processing) multiclass classification model for sentiment analysis, aim to achieve a __recall score of 80%__ and an __accuracy of 80%__. The model should categorize sentiments into three classes: __Positive__, __Negative__, and __Neutral__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- To idenitfy the most common words used in the dataset using Word cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To confirm the most common words that are positively and negatively tagged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To recognize the products that have been opined by the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To spot the distribution of the sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Conclusion \n",
    "Our NLP model will contribute valuable insights to the real-world problem of understanding Twitter sentiment about Apple and Google products. Stakeholders can leverage this information to enhance their decision-making processes and improve overall customer satisfaction."

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data source\n",
    "The dataset originates from __CrowdFlower via data.world__. Contributors evaluated tweets related to various brands and products. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each tweet was labeled as expressing __positive__, __negative__, __no emotion__ or __can't tell__ toward a brand or product.\n",
    "- If emotion was expressed, contributors specified which brand or product was the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Suitability of the Data\n",
    "Here's why this dataset is suitable for our project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Relevance__: The data directly aligns with our business problem of understanding Twitter sentiment for Apple and Google products.\n",
    "- __Real-World Context__: The tweets represent actual user opinions, making the problem relevant in practice.\n",
    "- __Multiclass Labels__: We can build both binary (positive/negative) and multiclass (positive/negative/neutral) classifiers using this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Dataset Size\n",
    "The dataset contains __over 9,000 labeled tweets__. We'll explore its features to gain insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "- __tweet_text__: The content of each tweet.\n",
    "- __is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product__: No emotion toward brand or product, Positive emotion, Negative emotion, I can't tell\n",
    "- __emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at__: The brand or product mentioned in the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Feature Selection\n",
    "__Tweet text__ is the primary feature. The emotion label and target brand/product are essential for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Data Limitations\n",
    "- __Label Noise__: Human raters' subjectivity may introduce noise.\n",
    "- __Imbalanced Classes__: We'll address class imbalance during modeling.\n",
    "- __Contextual Challenges__: Tweets are often short and context-dependent.\n",
    "- __Incomplete & Missing Data__: Could affect the overall performance of the models."

Corrupted data often includes non-ASCII characters, which may indicate unexpected special symbols, foreign language characters, or encoding issues that do not fit the expected data format. Detecting and removing these records is especially important when working with systems or processes that support only ASCII characters, as non-ASCII characters can cause errors or misinterpretations. By using the identified indexes, we can remove the corrupted records from the working DataFrame, ensuring consistency and compatibility in the dataset."

    "## 6. Text preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Text processing is a crucial step in preparing raw text data for analysis or machine learning tasks, transforming unstructured text into a more meaningful and manageable format. This process typically includes several important steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing Punctuation: Unnecessary punctuation marks are removed to simplify the text and avoid introducing irrelevant tokens during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or phrases (tokens), enabling detailed examination of each component. Tokenization lays the groundwork for all further text processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Converting to Lowercase: All characters are converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity and prevent duplicate tokens that only differ in case (e.g., \"Apple\" vs. \"apple\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Removing Stop Words: Commonly used words (like \"and,\" \"is,\" \"the\") are filtered out, as they add minimal semantic value. Removing these words helps to focus on the most meaningful terms in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Stemming and Lemmatization: Stemming reduces words to their root form by trimming suffixes (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\"), while lemmatization transforms words to their base or dictionary form based on context (e.g., \"better\" to \"good\"). This step ensures that different variations of a word are treated as a single term, improving consistency in text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these preprocessing steps help create a cleaner, more structured version of the text, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and classification."
